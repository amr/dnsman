<h1>How to create custom parking pages in DNSMan</h1>

<h2 class="subhead">Brief guidelines for using your existing static parking page in DNSMan</h2>

<div id="content-main">
  <p>Let's cut into the flesh with an example.</p>
  <p>Assume you were tasked with creating a parking page for N2V-owned sites. You should proceed as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a design in your favorite creative software package, share it with stakeholders, until you have acquired their approval</li>
    <li>Implement the design using good standard XHTML, adding additional resources such as CSS Stylesheets and Images</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have done that, your parking page should be displayable perfectly in your browser. In the next steps we will see how to upload it into DNSMan:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to DNSMan administration panel, and Add a new parking page</li>
  </ul>
</div>
